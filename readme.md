#Restaurant Menu App

## Introduction
This is an app to display restaurant menus. It was created as Project 3 for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree.

## Installation
This app was built using Python 2.7.6. If you want to use a different version of Python do so at your own risk.

1. Install all of the dependencies The easiest way to go about doing this is to install a vagrant virtual machine as described here: [https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant).

2. Run database_setup.py to create the proper database schema.

3. **(OPTIONAL)** Run lotsofmenus.py to populate the database with dummy data.

4. **(OPTIONAL)** If you want to use your own Google & Facebook account make sure to change the information client_secrets.json and fb_client_secrets.json. You should also change the data-clientid and appId in login.html. You should be able to find them with a text search.

5. Run project.py, which will start the Flask app and run a local server on port 5000. To access the app open a browser and navigate to localhost:5000
